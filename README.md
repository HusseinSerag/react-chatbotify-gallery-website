# OVERVIEW

## Getting Started

Fork and clone the repository then run the following command in the project directory.

1. To install the the necessary dependencies, run the following command:

```bash
npm install
```

2. To start the application, run the following command:

```bash
npm start
```
- Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
- The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Test and Build

#### Testing

To run tests, execute the following command:

```bash
npm test
```
- Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### Builds 

To run builds, execute the following command

```bash
npm run build
```

- Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
- The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
- See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

## Eject

⚠️⚠️ **Note:** This is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!\
To eject, you need to run the following command

```bash
npm run eject
```

- If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

- Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
